· I can navigate between Home, Explore and Bookmarks

· When I am on Home, I can post a new Tweet

· When I post a new Tweet, I can choose to upload an image and set the Tweet to be public or only-follower

· When I am on Home, I can see Tweets of people who I follow

· I can Comment, Retweet, Like or Save a Tweet

· I can Comment with image and I can like a comment

· I can see the posted time of the Comments and Tweets

· When I am on Home, I can see the most popular hashtags and people I should follow (it's up to you how to implement this)
